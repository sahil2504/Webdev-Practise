		<p>Absolute links are invariably unique. That is, for any specific copy of a document or for any specific page or directory on the Web, there exists one and only one absolute link. Within a specific domain, absolute links are not always used by page authors because once a computer has found its way to a certain domain or directory, it does not need to have that domain or directory name specified again in order to locate the sought-after item. Links are either absolute or relative. A relative link may consist of just a file name, because relative links only have to be unique within their domain or directory. When a relative link appears on a Web page, the browser understands that the file exists in the same domain or directory as the page itself. Relative links can be faster to load because the browser doesn’t have to start from scratch to find the site and then the content. Links are either absolute or relative.
